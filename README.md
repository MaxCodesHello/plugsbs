Free subdomains for anyone to use.

plug.sbs is a service i've created for people who want a subdomain, but just can't pay.

Basically, your first subdomain is free, and all subdomains after that cost $0.20 each, however we host many events in our discord to get unlimited free subdomains. 

In order to get a subdomain, here's what you do:

**1. Go to https://plug.sbs** ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68467297/156889438-175fee3e-e054-4fdc-b8b8-7192c3e988c5.png)
**2. Choose either the Discord option or the Google Forms option. (email isnt working atm)**
**3. If choosing discord, join the server, and DM the "DM for Subdomains" bot. If choosing Google Forms, it's self-explanatory.

You can also request a subdomain by making a pull request or starting a discussion on this repo. However this is only for free subdomains, if you want a paid one you'll have to do what it says above as we aren't accepting paid subdomain creation through the github.
